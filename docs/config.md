# Configuration

> This site explains how configuration is implemented and gives guidelines on
> how to extend or implemented your own configuration modules. For configuration
> we are using the [@nestjs/config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nestjs/config)
> package which is also documented on the [nestjs](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration)
> documentation site.

## Overview

### General Configuration
All Configuration is passed trough JSON-Files located in the following place

```bash
./config/config.{STAGE}.json
{STAGE} refers to the deployment stage this instance is running.
```

Currently we are planning to create the following stages:
- DEV
- TESTING
- PROD

The config file contains all static, non-secret information we need to start and run dBildung-iam-server.

#### Data Model
```json
{
  "HOST": {
    "PORT": <this is the server port>
  },
  "DB": {
    "CLIENT_URL": "<here goes your connection string>",
    "DB_NAME": "<here goes your db name>"
  },
  "KEYCLOAK": {
    "BASE_URL": "<URL of keycloak>",
    "REALM_NAME": "<name of the realm>",
    "CLIENT_ID": "<id of the client>"
  }
}
```

### Secrets Configuration
Secrets are provided inside the application in the same way as the static configuration.
```bash
./config/secrets.json
```

There are however a few special rules applied to them:

- This file is NEVER checked-in into the repository
- This file is created by the CI/CD pipeline with appropriate information for the given stage

#### Data Model
```json
{
    "DB": {
        "SECRET": "<here goes your secret>"
    },
    "KEYCLOAK": {
        "SECRET": "<secret token for the client>"
    }
}
```

## Developer Guide

The nest configuration package provides a module which must be imported to use the `ConfigService`.
We are using the config module as a global module, which makes the `ConfigService` globally available.
Here comes an example:

### Initialization
The ConfigModule is initialized in the ServerModule and can be used globally from there by injecting the ConfigService and loading the needed part of the configuration

```ts
ConfigModule.forRoot({
  isGlobal: true,
  validate: loadEnvConfig, //NestJs loads this first and is the only place it loads ENV-variables. We use this to load the current stage
  load: [loadConfig],
});
```

### Usage
```ts
class MyClass {
    public constructor(private readonly configService: ServerConfig<ServerConfig, true>) {}

    public myFunction(): void {
        // the config keys are compile time checked
        const env: DeployStage = this.configService.getOrThrow<DeployStage>('DEPLOY_STAGE');
        const dbConfig: DbConfig = this.configService.getOrThrow<DbConfig>('DB');
        const dbName: string = dbConfig.DB_NAME;
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Structure

![Configuration Composition Structure](./img/config-structure.svg)

* **General**
  * The configuration is loaded and validated on application startup
  * The validation uses decorators from the `class-validator` package
  * If the configuration is not valid, the application will stop with an error
  * The parsing from the environment and json is type safe
* **ServerConfig**
  * Is the top level configuration type and combines EnvConfig and JsonConfig
  * Should be used as the generic parameter e.g. `ConfigService<ServerConfig, true>`
* **EnvConfig**
  * Is loaded from environment variables and .env file
  * This is used to determine the correct deployment environment
* **JsonConfig**
  * Is loaded form an environment specific json file
  * Json files can be found in the `config` folder in the repository root

## How to expand the configuration?

* Where to put the new config value?
  * If it's secret, than put it into the `EnvConfig`
    * Annotate the new property with the desired decorators
    * IMPORTANT: Do NOT put complex types into the `EnvConfig`, only primitive values
  * If it's something like a feature flag, than put it into the `JsonConfig`
    * Annotate the new property with the desired decorators
* Do I want to expand an existing config class like `DbConfig`? If yes, than do the following steps:
  * Put the new configuration value in the desired class
  * Annotate the new property with the desired decorators
* I wan to add configuration for a new feature
  * Use the `DbConfig` as reference
    * [ ] Create a new class in the `src/shared/config` folder
    * [ ] Annotate the properties with the desired decorators
    * [ ] Add your config to the `JsonConfig` class with the required decorators
    * [ ] Add your config class to the `src/shared/config/index.ts` file
    * [ ] Add default values to the environment specific json files
