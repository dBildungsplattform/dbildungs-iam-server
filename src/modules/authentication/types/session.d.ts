// The redirect saved in Passport is necessary to direct the user
// back to their intended location after a step-up authentication (e.g., admin area).
// This is because Keycloak, when internally forwarding to 2FA, loses the redirect
// information from the query parameters. Thus, it must be forwarded from the original request.
// The session's user passport has been utilized to store this information.
// Both redirect mechanisms are essential: the first one saves the query parameter
// for the redirect in the LoginGuard, and the second ensures that the user is forwarded
// to their desired location after the step-up process.
