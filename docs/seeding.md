# Seeding data

Seeding of data for all environments is done via JSON files per entity-type or aggregate.

- files for local execution when developing on the project are stored in `seeding/dev`

- files for integration tests and unit-tests of the seeding mechanism itself are stored in `seeding/seeding-integration-test`

- files for seeding in the different Kubernetes environments are stored in `charts/dbildungs-iam-server/seeding/dev`

## Referencing

Some data is referencing other data, e.g. ServiceProvider are provided by SchulstrukturKnoten and therefore have an attribute _providedOnSchulstrukturknoten_.
At the moment there is a transition going on. In the past attributes like _providedOnSchulstrukturknoten_ would have been the exact ID/UUID
of the record in another table in the DB.
To create a more flexible and less hard-coded way of seeding data, the new approach is to use (virtual) seeding-IDs which are only valid
in the seeding-files and will be interpreted only during the seeding process and by services of the seeding mechanism.

At the moment following types of seeding-files use the old approach with concrete IDs/UUIDs: `ServiceProvider`, `DataProvider`.
The other files are using the new approach, e.g. Rollen, Personen and Organisationen are referenced in Personenkontext by virtual seeding-IDs.


## Order of execution

Seeding-files are applied in alphanumerical order.
E.g. `person.json` will be applied before `rolle.json`.

Naming of sub-directories is influencing the order in same way.
E.g. `seeding/dev/01/rolle.json` is applied before `seeding/dev/02/person.json`

The use of prefixes like 01_, 02_ ect is therefore recommended.
E.g. `seeding/dev/01/04_rolle.json`, `seeding/dev/01/05_personenkontext.json` (Rollen have to exists before Personenkontexte)

## Format of seeding-files

Every seeding-file has two attributes:
- entityName: type of the entity used for the entities (this must match the current list of defined types in _db-seed.console.ts_)
- entities: list of all entities to be seeded

Example for a seeding-file for service-providers (old way of referencing)

```json
{
    "entityName": "ServiceProvider",
    "entities": [
        {
            "name": "itslearning",
            "url": "https://itslearning.com/de",
            "kategorie": "UNTERRICHT",
            "providedOnSchulstrukturknoten": "d39cb7cf-2f9b-45f1-849f-973661f2f057"
        },
        {
            "name": "E-Mail",
            "url": "https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Mail",
            "kategorie": "EMAIL",
            "logoMimeType": "image/png",
            "logoBase64": "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",

        }
    ]
}
```

Example for a seeding-file for organisations (new way of referencing)
```json
{
    "entityName": "Organisation",
    "entities": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "kennung": "Root",
            "name": "Root Organisation",
            "kuerzel": "Root",
            "typ": "TRAEGER",
            "administriertVon": null,
            "zugehoerigZu": null
        },
        {
            "id": 1,
            "kennung": "Organisation1",
            "name": "Träger1",
            "namensergaenzung": "Keine",
            "kuerzel": "O1",
            "typ": "TRAEGER",
            "administriertVon": 0,
            "zugehoerigZu": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

## Execution of seeding

Advice: In general running `npm run db:init` before seeding is recommended.

The command for seeding is:
`npm run db:seed $DIRECTORY`

- $DIRECTORY: is mandatory (every file *.json in every sub-directory within is read)

### Examples of use:
If you want to use custom seeding-files in a directory seeding/MySeedingFiles, execute:
`npm run db:seed MySeedingFiles`

## Skipping of files

Files are skipped when either
- a certain seeding-file is already applied (based on SHA265 checksum)
- applying certain seeding-file already failed in the past (based on SHA265 checksum)
- if checksum of an already applied file changes due to new data, it is treated as a new file
- if you want to add new seeding data, please create new files and do not edit already existing ones
- referencing yet existing seeding data via their (virtual-)ids in new seeding data is possible

## Error handling

If a seeding-file cannot be applied due to errors in format, non-existing references, faulty attribute values ect., the seeding process will stop and the error will be logged.
All files which would have been applied after the malicious file ARE NOT applied in the same run.
However, they can be applied by doing another run of seeding, because the malicious file will be skipped.
