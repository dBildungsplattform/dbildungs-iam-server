# Architecture

## Domain Driven Design

We follow the principles of domain driven design.<br>
**Business logic is handled in the domain layer.**

### Aggregates, Factories, Repositories ###
Business logic is mainly handled within an *aggregate*. If that is not possible, e.g. because a domain operation affects multiple *aggregates* a domain *service* is used.<br>

A new instance of an *aggregate* is created by a *factory*.<br>
To load an instance of an*aggregate* from the persistence layer a *repository* is used. Internally the *repository* loads the data and uses the *factory* to construct the *aggregate*.<br>
A changed or newly created *aggregate* is persisted via a *repository*.<br>

For cross cutting concerns we use shared *services*. *Aggregates* are constructed by *factories*, thus Nest.js can not inject *services* directly into the *aggregates*. We need to inject dependencies of an *aggregate* into the *factory* and hand them over during construction.

### Controllers ###

To expose an API we use *controllers*. *Controllers* call *aggregates* and domain *services*. They expose *DTOs* with Decorators to generate the OpenApi Specification.

The *controller* can call multiple aggregates to collect all data necessary e.g. get a Personenkontext and than call the RolleRepo to get the roles name.

The *controller* checks that parameters have the correct structure, but they do not perform consistency checks or specifactions. Specifications are checked by the *aggregate* itself, if only the *aggregate* itself is concerned, otherwise the *repository* checks before persisting.

### Diagram ###
The following diagram shows the class structure and how to create (1a, 2a, 3, 4) or how to edit (1b, 2b, 3, 4) data.

Old modules still follow the class structure as it was defined in dBildungscloud.

## Modules

A *module* contains a cohesive portion of the domain. <br>

A *module* can contain both injectables for internal use only and injectables that are meant to be consumed by other modules.
Decide what injectables to put in the *module's* `exports`-array instead of defaulting to export everything "just in case".

## Authorization

Authorization is done in the *aggregates*.<br>
We are planning to create a shared *service* that handles the check based on the user's Personenkontexts (that contain the user's roles and rights) and the rights necessary to perform an operation.

If a service triggers operations in multiple *aggregates*, each *aggregate* will need to perform its own check. A user's roles and rights should be cached in the request context to not retrieve them for each check.
The services do not check the user rights again to avoid code duplication.

## Integrity Checks

We need check conditions for data integrity e.g. an organisation of type form (Klasse) can not be administrated by an organisation of type school sponsor (Schultr√§ger), but only by a school.
To check these conditions we use the specification pattern for reusability.
An Aggregate can run its own Specifications. This can be done while creating the Aggregate.

Before persisting an aggregate the Specifications need to be checked. The Repository must trigger the check. We do not rely on the controller to do it reliably.
