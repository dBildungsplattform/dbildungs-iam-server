# dBildungs IAM Server

## Prerequisites

- Node in the version stated in the [package.json](./package.json)
- Container Runtime [Rancher-Desktop](https://www.rancher.com/products/rancher-desktop), Docker or Podman
    - Is required for local setup and integration tests

## Local Setup

1. Clone this repository. Make sure that `git autorcrlf` is set to `false`. You can set this with `git config --global core.autocrlf false`. Otherwise Kafke will not run properly in the later steps.
2. Run `npm ci` to install all dependencies ([What's that?](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-ci))
3. Start the required services from the `compose.yaml` file with `docker compose --profile third-party up` ([What's that?](https://docs.docker.com/compose/))
    - db
    - keycloak
    - redis
4. run `npm run setup` to initialize the DB and seed data
5. Run `npm run start` to start the server
6. Server runs on the url printed in the console
7. The client and how to run it is described in the [client repo](https://github.com/dBildungsplattform/schulportal-client)

## Docker Compose

The compose file includes different [profiles](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/profiles/) so you can mix and match between them to fit your usecase. For an overview see [Available profiles](#available-profiles).

If you only need to run the server, you can start it and all it's required dependencies with docker compose by running

```sh
docker compose --profile backend up
```

Optional dependencies are in the `third-party` profile. So for the complete backend run

```sh
docker compose --profile backend --profile third-party up
```

The frontend-client (and a necessary ingress) can be started with the `frontend` profile, assuming a certificate for the ingress has been created. You can use `create-cert.sh` inside `nginx/` to do so. Afterwards you can start front- and backend together with:

```sh
docker compose --profile backend --profile frontend up
```

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs like 'Error response from daemon: network c28f1... not found',
> you can clean docker resources up with _docker system prune -a_.

To bootstrap a minimal setup with front- and backend use `docker-bootstrap.sh`. Depending on your setup you may need to set the correct permissions for the script with i.e. `chmod +x docker-bootstrap.sh`. It will start required services and init and seed the database. **Please note** that this will clear the database.

If you need to initialize the database without seeding it, use `docker compose up db-init` do so.
You can also use another profile, if you want to initialize the db while starting the server `docker compose --profile backend --profile db-init up`
Similarly you may use

- `db-migrate` to migrate schema changes to your current database
- `db-seed` to seed the database
- `keycloak-client-update` to update the keycloak client

## Developer Guides

- Code conventions are enforced through the compile, eslint and prettier as far as possible
    - Non enforcable conventions will be documented here. If they become enforcable we will put them into
      automation.
    - Table names will be all lowercase if the name contains multiple words they will be separated by
      underscores.
- Git conventions can be found [here](./docs/git.md)
- Test conventions can be found [here](./docs/tests.md)
- Configuration conventions can be found [here](./docs/config.md)
- Authentication guides can be found [here](./docs/auth.md)
- Developer notes can be found [here](./docs/developer-notes.md)
